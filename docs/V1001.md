## 1. Overview
Blackjack Spotlight is the side‑game unlocked when the player builds their first Sponsors building.  
It is a fast, deterministic, single‑hand blackjack minigame that rewards the player with **Ace Tokens** specifically themed as “sponsor payouts”.

The game is intentionally short (one hand, ~5–10 seconds) and designed to be replayed in bursts, creating a controlled dopamine loop without destabilising the core Ace Token economy.

## 2. Core Gameplay Flow (State Machine)

**Code**  
`IDLE → DEAL → PLAYER_TURN → RESOLVE → PAYOUT → IDLE`

**IDLE**  
- Game UI closed or waiting for player input.  
- No pending rewards.

**DEAL**  
- Player and dealer each receive 2 cards.  
- Player: both cards face‑up.  
- Dealer: one card face‑up, one face‑down.  
- Initial blackjack check (player only).

**PLAYER_TURN**  
- Player chooses between:
  - **HIT** (draw one card)  
  - **STAND** (end turn)  
- No splits, no doubles, no insurance.  
- Bust if total > 21 → immediate loss.

**RESOLVE**  
- Dealer reveals hidden card.  
- Dealer draws according to fixed rules:
  - Hit until total ≥ 17  
  - Stand on 17+  
- Bust if total > 21.

**PAYOUT**  
- Compare totals if no bust:
  - Player bust → LOSS  
  - Dealer bust → WIN  
  - Higher total wins  
  - Equal total → PUSH (no reward)  
- Apply fixed Ace Token reward ladder (see below).  
- Return to IDLE.

## 3. Reward Logic (Locked)

**Reward Type**  
- Immediate Ace Token payout.  
- Thematically: “Sponsor payout” from the Sponsors building.  
- Does **not** affect any building speed or timers.

**Base Reward**  
- Each completed hand (WIN only) grants a fixed Ace Token amount based on bet tier.  
- Bet tiers are **UI‑locked** (no free text input).

**Example Ladder (Locked Structure, Tunable Values in Economy Doc Only)**  
- **Small Bet:** X Ace Tokens  
- **Medium Bet:** Y Ace Tokens  
- **Large Bet:** Z Ace Tokens  

**Blackjack Bonus**  
- Natural blackjack (21 on initial 2 cards) pays **1.5×** the selected bet reward.  
- No other multipliers.

**Loss / Push**  
- LOSS: Player receives **0** Ace Tokens.  
- PUSH: No gain, no loss.

**Economy Constraints**  
- Blackjack Spotlight must be tuned so that:
  - It is **net neutral or slightly negative** over long‑term play.  
  - It feels rewarding in the short term without becoming a primary Ace Token generator.  
- All numeric values (X/Y/Z) are defined in the economy sheet, not in this document.

## 4. Data Model

**State**

```ts
state = {
  phase: 'IDLE' | 'DEAL' | 'PLAYER_TURN' | 'RESOLVE' | 'PAYOUT',
  playerHand: Card[],
  dealerHand: Card[],
  betTier: 'SMALL' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LARGE',
  result: 'WIN' | 'LOSE' | 'PUSH' | null
}
```

**Card**

```ts
type Card = {
  rank: 'A' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' | '10' | 'J' | 'Q' | 'K',
  suit: '♠' | '♥' | '♦' | '♣',
  value: number,      // blackjack value (A handled specially)
  faceUp: boolean
}
```

**Deck**  
- Single virtual deck per hand.  
- Shuffled deterministically using a seeded RNG or fixed sequence.  
- No card counting, no multi‑deck simulation.

---

## 5. UI Requirements

**Layout**  
- Player hand at bottom, dealer hand at top.  
- Clear display of:
  - Player total  
  - Dealer visible total (when appropriate)  
  - Bet tier selection  
- Buttons:
  - **HIT**  
  - **STAND**  
  - **Play Again** (after PAYOUT)

**Animations**  
- Simple, deterministic card deal animations (slide‑in).  
- Flip animation for dealer’s hidden card.  
- Result banner: WIN / LOSE / PUSH.  
- Small Ace Token “burst” animation on WIN.

**Integration with Sponsors Building**  
- Entry point: button or icon on the Sponsors building panel.  
- Optional small label: “Blackjack Spotlight”.

## 6. Economy & Balance Notes

- Blackjack Spotlight is a **side faucet**, not a primary Ace Token source.  
- Expected value per hand should be slightly negative over time.  
- Bet tiers are capped and controlled via UI.  
- No streak bonuses, no compounding multipliers.  
- No offline behaviour: rewards are instant and self‑contained.

---

## 7. Technical Notes

- No server calls.  
- All logic runs client‑side.  
- Deck generation and dealing must be deterministic and reproducible.  
- Aces count as 1 or 11 using standard blackjack rules:
  - Use the highest valid total ≤ 21.  
- Result calculation must be fully deterministic given the deck order and player choices.

---

## 8. Deliverables

- `V1001.md` (this document)  
- Svelte component: `BlackjackSpotlight.svelte`  
- Store module: `sponsorsBlackjack.ts` (state + reward application)  
- UI assets: card faces, card backs, Ace Token burst  
- Deterministic deck helper: `createDeck()` + `dealCard()` + `calculateTotal()`

---

## 9. Drift Prevention

- No splits, no doubles, no insurance.  
- No side bets.  
- No progressive jackpots.  
- No streak‑based bonuses.  
- No additional bet types beyond SMALL / MEDIUM / LARGE.  
- No cross‑building effects (Sponsors only).  
- No timers, no idle boosts, no speed multipliers.  
- No auto‑play or auto‑hit.  
- Any change to rules, payouts, or structure requires a new version document (V1002+).
