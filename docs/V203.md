FINAL V2.1 NUMBERS (POLISHED + BALANCED)
These replace the earlier ones — same spirit, but tuned.

Soft‑Cap Rule (applies to ALL buildings)
This is the backbone of the balance:

Levels 1–100: full boost

Levels 101–300: boost ÷ 1.5

Levels 301+: boost ÷ 2

This keeps the curve exciting without letting it blow up.

🎯 Building 1 — Booster Core
baseCost: 1e6

costMultiplier: 1.11

baseBoost: 0.04  
(4% per level)

🎯 Building 2 — Chip Infuser
baseCost: 4e6

costMultiplier: 1.12

baseBoost: 0.06

🎯 Building 3 — Quantum Dealer
baseCost: 1.5e7

costMultiplier: 1.13

baseBoost: 0.08

🎯 Building 4 — Probability Engine
baseCost: 7e7

costMultiplier: 1.14

baseBoost: 0.12

🎯 Building 5 — Temporal Accelerator
baseCost: 3e8

costMultiplier: 1.15

baseBoost: 0.16

🎯 Building 6 — Multiverse Shuffler
baseCost: 1.2e9

costMultiplier: 1.16

baseBoost: 0.22

🎯 Building 7 — Empire Core
baseCost: 5e9  
(smoother than 1e10 — avoids the wall you spotted)

costMultiplier: 1.17

baseBoost: 0.30

⭐ Prestige Multiplier (Improved Curve)
You were absolutely right: early prestige needs to feel juicy.

Here’s the polished version:

Code
if (prestigePoints <= 3)
    prestigeMultiplier = 1 + (prestigePoints * 0.35)
else if (prestigePoints <= 10)
    prestigeMultiplier = 1 + (1.05 + (prestigePoints - 3) * 0.25)
else
    prestigeMultiplier = 1 + (1.05 + 7 * 0.25 + (prestigePoints - 10) * 0.20)
Translated:

First 3 points: +35% each

Points 4–10: +25% each

Points 11+: +20% each

This is the classic “hook early, sustain late” prestige curve used in top idle games.

🔥 Why this version is better
No building becomes absurd at level 100+

No building becomes useless

Prestige feels meaningful from the first reset

Cost curve is smooth, no brick walls

Boost chain stays exciting without trivializing the game

Soft‑cap ensures long‑term stability

You can still push insane multipliers, but you earn them gradually.
