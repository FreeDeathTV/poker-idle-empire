# **ADR‑1504: Ace‑Token Economy Integration for Heads‑Up Hold’em Ladder Mode**

## **Context**
The Heads‑Up Hold’em Ladder Mode (ADR‑1500) introduces a new high‑engagement, skill‑based feature inside the Ace‑Token Shop. ADR‑1501 defined the betting engine and blind ladder, and ADR‑1502 defined the CPU AI system. ADR‑1503 established the progression modal and local leaderboard.

This mode must integrate cleanly with the existing **Ace‑Token economy**, which currently serves as a premium currency used for unlocking features, purchasing boosts, and accessing special content. The new Hold’em mode must:

- Use Ace‑Tokens as the **entry cost**  
- Provide Ace‑Tokens and/or chips as **rewards**  
- Fit naturally into the existing economy without destabilizing it  
- Create a meaningful **sink** that encourages long‑term engagement  
- Support progression gating and leaderboard ranking  

This ADR defines the economic rules, reward structures, and integration points.

## **Decision**
Introduce a **tiered Ace‑Token entry and reward system** tied directly to the CPU ladder. Each match requires an Ace‑Token buy‑in, and rewards scale with opponent difficulty. The system remains fully client‑side and deterministic.

The economy integration includes:

- Entry cost per match  
- Reward scaling per tier  
- Win streak bonuses  
- Loss penalties  
- Leaderboard token tracking  
- Progression gating (5 wins per opponent)  

This creates a closed, balanced loop that reinforces the Ace‑Token Shop as the home of premium challenges.

---

## **Entry Cost Structure**
Each match requires an Ace‑Token buy‑in. Costs scale with CPU difficulty:

- **Tier 1 — TheNorm:** 1 Ace‑Token  
- **Tier 2 — AnyAceNick:** 2 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 3 — RedTheRiot:** 3 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 4 — CrazyHorse:** 4 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 5 — MrMark:** 5 Ace‑Tokens  

This scaling:

- Matches difficulty  
- Encourages progression  
- Creates a meaningful token sink  
- Keeps early tiers accessible  

Entry cost is deducted immediately when the match begins.

---

## **Reward Structure**
Rewards scale with difficulty and are deterministic.

### **Win Rewards**
- **Tier 1:** +2 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 2:** +4 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 3:** +6 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 4:** +8 Ace‑Tokens  
- **Tier 5:** +12 Ace‑Tokens  

This ensures:

- Higher tiers feel valuable  
- Players profit long‑term only through skill  
- The mode remains a token sink overall  

### **Loss Penalty**
- Player loses the entry cost  
- No additional penalty  

This keeps the system fair and predictable.

---

## **Optional Chip Rewards**
To reinforce the idle progression loop, wins may also grant chips:

- **Tier 1:** 1,000 chips  
- **Tier 2:** 2,500 chips  
- **Tier 3:** 5,000 chips  
- **Tier 4:** 10,000 chips  
- **Tier 5:** 25,000 chips  

Chip rewards are optional and can be toggled in balancing.

---

## **Win Streak Bonuses**
To encourage repeat play:

- Every **3 consecutive wins** grants +1 bonus Ace‑Token  
- Every **5 consecutive wins** grants +3 bonus Ace‑Tokens  

Streaks reset on loss.

This adds excitement without destabilizing the economy.

---

## **Progression Gating**
Players must defeat each CPU **five times** to unlock the next tier. Ace‑Token rewards are only granted for wins; losses do not progress the ladder.

This ensures:

- A clear sense of mastery  
- Natural difficulty curve  
- Controlled access to higher‑value rewards  

---

## **Leaderboard Integration**
The leaderboard tracks:

- Total Ace‑Tokens won  
- Total Ace‑Tokens spent  
- Net profit  
- Win streaks  
- Highest tier beaten  

CPU opponents also have deterministic “career stats” for flavour.

This creates a competitive environment without multiplayer.

---

## **Economy Safeguards**
To prevent inflation:

- Entry costs always exceed expected value for low‑skill players  
- Higher tiers require skill to profit  
- Streak bonuses are capped  
- Rewards are deterministic, not random  
- No jackpots or exponential payouts  

This keeps Ace‑Tokens valuable.

---

## **Integration Points**

### **With ADR‑1501 (Betting Engine)**
- Engine reports win/loss  
- Economy applies token delta  

### **With ADR‑1502 (AI System)**
- Difficulty tiers map to entry cost and rewards  

### **With ADR‑1503 (Progression Modal & Leaderboard)**
- Modal displays token requirements  
- Leaderboard tracks token performance  

### **With Ace‑Token Shop**
- Mode appears as a premium challenge  
- Entry cost deducted from token balance  

---

## **Rationale**
This structure:

- Strengthens the Ace‑Token economy  
- Adds a premium, skill‑based challenge  
- Encourages repeat play  
- Keeps everything deterministic and client‑side  
- Avoids inflation  
- Fits naturally into the existing UI and progression systems  

It also sets the stage for future expansions (Limit mode, Omaha, new CPUs, daily challenges).

---

## **Consequences**

### Positive
- Strong token sink  
- High replay value  
- Skill‑based progression  
- Balanced reward loop  
- No server or multiplayer required  

### Negative
- Requires careful tuning to avoid over‑rewarding  
- Requires UI updates to show token deltas  
- Player may feel punished if early tiers are too easy  

---

## **Status**
**Accepted.**  
This completes the ADR‑1500 series for the Heads‑Up Hold’em Ladder Mode.
