Status: Approved
Scope: Locked
Drift: Not permitted
Version: 1100
Feature: Landing Page + In‑App Home/Ace Token Hub
Reward Type: None (structural UX feature)
Economy Impact: Token visibility only (no sinks yet)

1. Overview
V1100 introduces a new Landing Page and an in‑app Home/Ace Token Hub.
This creates a clean onboarding flow, improves PWA installation rates, and establishes the foundation for future Ace Token sinks (shop, cosmetics, daily deals).

The Landing Page becomes the public entry point.
The Home/Ace Token Hub becomes the internal app home screen, accessible from the game header.

This version does not introduce any new gameplay or token sinks.
It only establishes the structure.

2. Core UX Flow
New User Flow
User visits the Landing Page (web browser).

Page explains the game and prominently displays the Install App button.

User installs the PWA.

User launches the app from their home screen.

App opens directly into the main game.

A new Home/Ace Token button in the header returns them to the Landing Page (inside the PWA).

Installed User Flow
User taps the app icon on their device.

App opens in standalone mode.

User can:

Play the game normally

Tap Home/Ace Tokens to view token balance and future shop

Return to the game at any time

This creates a clean loop:

Landing Page → Install → App → Home/Ace Tokens → Game → Home → Game
